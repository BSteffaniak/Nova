* Make arguments and parameters more strict.
* Make BlockNode for the parent of all Method-based blocks in order to declare local variables.
* Use RAII variable initialization when possible.
* Make a nice missing ending } error message.
* Possibly add === operator.
* Allow field initialization
* Add generic support
* Add scopes within until statement in SyntaxStability
* Add swift-style switch statements
* Sub-classes must initialize default values to the super-class variables too.
X Rename Integer to Int
* Fix the conflict between data type output and polymorphic type casts.
* Can Constructor use generateCNameOutput()?
X Fix the setScope() method to not break sub-classing.
X Make sure there are no external method name collisions.
* Do we need generateCVirtualMethodName()?
* Fix single line comment on first line.
* Check Java for inner-class inheritence of generic parameters.
* Add support for virtual destructor calls. (For generic types)

Remove the '0' exception in SyntaxUtils.validateCompatibleTypes()

In-depth compiler error checking:
- Make sure that the static class's methods/variables are called rightfully.
- Include the caller of a method and variable and such.

Test cases:
  char c[] = new String[52];
  varName.methodCall().varName2
  i.value++
  Multi-dimensional arrays
	
Things to fix:
  Return node - more careful
  DivideByZeroException checker
  MethDecl decodeParams
  IIdentifier.setType

Things to improve:
  Clean up File validation methods.
  Make Values actually hold Values for their types (instead of Strings).


Default Exceptions to Implement:
  CastException
  ArrayAccessException

Create 'or' & 'and' keywords.
